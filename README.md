Animating human faces has been widely explored in the field of computer vision. 
Generally, existing methods can be divided into two main categories: 
computer graphics–based approaches, which rely on modeling a 3D human head, and 
generative model–based approaches,which are trained on large-scale datasets and can animate a human face from a single input image. 
Recent advances in diffusion models have further expanded these possibilities, enabling the animation of not only the head but the entire human body. 
This progress has opened up a wide range of applications in the film and animation industries.
Tasks:
- Understanding the fundamentals of generative modeling
- Exploring recent methods for human face and gesture animation
- Running recent works (e.g., AnimateAnyone) and improving the pipeline based on my suggestions.
